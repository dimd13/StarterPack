# Usage

All path configurations should be administrable from ```project.config.js``` file. You can change where are stored views or assets folder by this way, pass some config for PostCss, and so on.

**homePage** point to the template you want to render (not the layout, the template).

**viewsPath** are related to the folder of all views basicly ```src/views```

**assetsPath** where all commons files are stored (css, js, images, etc.)/

> **viewsPath** and **assetsPath** are used by BrowserSync to know file who watch


**aliases** are used to reproduce **{% extends "@STARTERPack/layout.html.twig" %}** 

**neatConfig** and **cssNextConfig** are used by PostCSS modules.

## Twig Filter and functions mock

StarterPack use [node-twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-twig) to render Twig templates. You can find mocks for Twig in the ```extensions``` folder.
